I hope you have been well! We have run into an issue on the Gownies site that I was wondering if you could look into and fix for us.

When the customer checks out, we can not see the gift message they typed. It seems to disappear. We do not have this issue on Baby Be Mine, just the Gownies site.

Please let me know if you can fix this, it needs to be done ASAP as people are ordering these for the holidays. And please let me know the price as well.
---There is no access to the order page in the admin panel due to which I am not able to see the gift message. I need access to the admin panel. thank you See the screenshot - https://prnt.sc/B73mJZJ2xPOn

Thank you

HELP!  A problem with the work you did on my cart!  Someone just selected rush shipping and now I can not access the additional information that they put in on the custom fields you designed.  PLEASE HELP this is live...  
-----access has been removed.See the screenshot  https://prnt.sc/8zJYy6Tt0ey6

    
I'm not sure if this is something you're able to assist with but we have two stores using the Dawn theme that would like to add size charts using metafields.

The metafield and pages have been completed but I can't find a good way to add it to the product pages so that it links to the individual size chart pages for each product and shows up in a way that is easy to read. I initially tried adding it as a collapsible row then making the metafield the row content but that causes the row to show up even on hard good products that don't have a size chart and the image is so small you can't read it. A screenshot is attached of what it looks like now.

Is this something you can help with?

Here are the stores we are trying to accomplish this with:
043fc0-2.myshopify.com
outkick.myshopify.com
=======>  I will add the chart in 2 -3 products and I will give you a guide video. Thanks
------Done.

Thank you








Thank you

Hi Rashmi,
We are running into a slight issue with the customers purchasing the gift bags on both sites. Would it be possible to add some text next to the “add gift bag” section on both websites?
We need to add “Two items per gift bag. If your order exceeds two items, please add additional gift wrap.” To the “Add gift wrap” section.
Please let me know if that is possible. So sorry to add amendments to this but would appreciate if it could be done ASAP. Let me know how much we would owe you for this as this is our error. 
After this, we have more projects we would like to discuss. We enjoy working with you. Thank you!

----Done. See the screenshot - main cart - https://prnt.sc/VAnbuucrMENj, Cart drawer - https://prnt.sc/cMYiELk0YtKK

1. I can't add it directly to my cart on my computer. I also tested it on my colleague's computer, but it didn't workeither. But on the link you sent, I can click to add to the shopping cart. Why is this?
-----It is running fine on our desktop.

2. If it shows that it is not possible on our side, it will be no problem when you test it. Is it because our theme version is different or there is an error?
-----No, there is no version problem.

Thank you
