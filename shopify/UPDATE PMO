Optimization details are done by me as per PageSpeed Insights :
As you need help to improve your site speed, I have fullfilled all parameter which is given below:
- Optimise theme Javascript using defer, async or minify
------Done.
- Optimise theme CSS by minifying it, removed unused CSS
------Done.
- Optimise images (using code, image compression app, lazy load as needed)
------Done.
- Clean-up leftover/obsolete codes causing unnecessary heavy page size.
------Done.
- Eliminate Render-blocking resources
------Done.
Defer offscreen images
------Done.
You are using so many apps so the site is taking time to load. So we can't do more than that but I have done as much as possible.I hope you understand me better.
You can check and publish the theme now. if any feedback then let me know.
Feel free to share your feedback/changes, if any.


thank you...
