Hi Rashmi,

We would like to do the same thing as we did on the Gownies site, adding a “add gift bag” option to checkout, to our other website Baby Be Mine. Could you give us a price to do that same thing?

https://www.babybeminematernit ... ts/gift-wrap-service

Also, we have noticed that on Gownies there is a space missing for the customer to write a personal message that comes on the card included with the gift wrapping. We would like to have this added, and also put into the Baby Be Mine site once the gift wrap option is made.

----Done. See the screenshot - main cart -https://prnt.sc/uLE0sgOdiYZp , Cart drawer - https://prnt.sc/UF0bnRFxLypS

1. I can't add it directly to my cart on my computer. I also tested it on my colleague's computer, but it didn't workeither. But on the link you sent, I can click to add to the shopping cart. Why is this?
-----It is running fine on our desktop.

2. If it shows that it is not possible on our side, it will be no problem when you test it. Is it because our theme version is different or there is an error?
-----No, there is no version problem.

Thank you

Optimization details are done by me as per PageSpeed Insights :
As you need help to improve your site speed, I have fullfilled all parameter which is given below:
- Optimise theme Javascript using defer, async or minify
------Done.
- Optimise theme CSS by minifying it, removed unused CSS
------Done.
- Optimise images (using code, image compression app, lazy load as needed)
------Done.
- Clean-up leftover/obsolete codes causing unnecessary heavy page size.
------Done.
- Eliminate Render-blocking resources
------Done.
Defer offscreen images
------Done.
You are using so many apps so the site is taking time to load. So we can't do more than that but I have done as much as possible.I hope you understand me better.
You can check and publish the theme now. if any feedback then let me know.
Feel free to share your feedback/changes, if any.


thank you...
